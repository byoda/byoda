# Take back yourÂ data!

Bring Your Own Data and Algorithms (BYODA) is a radical new and open social media platform.
- Your data is stored in your own data pod. You have full access to it and full control about granting and withdrawing access to others.
- Anyone can develop apps and services on the platform.
- The platform is open source; every one can contribute and privacy and security researchers can review the code.

The goal BYODA is to break the power that social media companies have over our society:
- Own your data, not the social media companies.
- Select the algorithm to create your feed instead of social media companies providing you with content that generates the most revenue for them.
- Switch easily between services by granting services access to some of your already available data. 

BYODA will provide a software development kit for building social media services. This will make it easier and quicker to develop new services or update existing services. As you can decide to allow a new service access to some or all of the data you have stored for other services, it becomes easier for new social media services to reach critical mass and benefit from the 'network effect'. Making it easier for new social media services to get started will increase competition in the social media market.

Today, social media services run their proprietary algorithms that push content to you to maximize the number of ads they can make you watch. With BYODA, you will be able to select an algorithm from a list of available open-source and propriety algorithms to run in your pod that you have found is best at selecting the content that you want you to consume.

I came up with the idea of BYODA after watching the documentary 'The Social Dilemma' on the dangerous human impact of social networking. I believe a fundamental redesign is required of how social media services are delivered in order to reduce the power the top social media companies have and reduce their negative impact on our society. This project is not just about software development and adoption by people like you. To force the dominant social media services to adopt this model, I believe legislation will need to be enacted. BYODA is not a quick-fix but more of a marathon and will need all the support it can get.

There are three mailing lists for this project:

* [Discussions about the Byoda project](https://groups.io/g/takebackyourdata-discuss)
* [Discussions between developers of Byoda components](https://groups.io/g/takebackyourdata-dev)
