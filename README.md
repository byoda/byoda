# Take back yourÂ data!

Bring Your Own Data and Algorithms (BYODA) is a radical new and open social media platform under development:
- All your data is stored in your own data pod. You have full access to your data and full control to give and withdraw access to that data to others.
- You can select the algorithms to generate your feed.
- Anyone can develop apps and services on the platform.
- The platform is open source; every one can contribute or review the code.

I came up with the idea of BYODA after watching the documentary 'The Social Dilemma' on the dangerous impact of social networking companies on our own mental health and on our society as a whole. I believe a fundamental redesign of how social media services are delivered is required in order to reduce the power the top social media companies have and reduce their negative impact on our society. 

Social media platforms are a natural monopoly because of the *network effect*: the more people use a platform, the more interesting it is for other people to use that platform. Social media platforms use that monopoly to maximize their profit and block competition. The goal of BYODA is to break the power that social media companies have over our society by attacking their monopoly:
- Reduce profit: 
  - You own your data. Don't donate your data to social media companies for them to exploit it.
  - You select the algorithm to create your feed. Don't let social media companies decide for you what content you see in your feed.
- Enable competition:
  - You can easily discover and try out new services so that new social media services have a chance of competing with the established players.
  - Selectively grant new services access to your existing data to give them a head start in offering meaningful services to you.
  - Byoda reduces the software development and platform cost for new social media services by providing an SDK and a storage platform

This project is not just about software development and adoption by people like you; to force the dominant social media services to adopt this model, I believe legislation will need to be enacted. BYODA is not a quick-fix but more of a marathon and will need all the support it can get.

Storing data in your own private pod is not a new concept but BYODA introduces a data contract between you and a service you sign up for. The data contract is a technical specification of all data that the service can store and fetch from your data pod. In [some blog articles I wrote](https://stevenhessing.medium.com/), you can read more about how this data contract can fundamentally change how social media services work.

There are three mailing lists for this project:

* [Discussions about the Byoda project](https://groups.io/g/takebackyourdata-discuss)
* [Discussions between developers of Byoda components](https://groups.io/g/takebackyourdata-dev)
