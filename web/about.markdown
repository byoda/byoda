I came up with the idea of BYODA after watching the documentary ['The Social Dilemma'](https://www.thesocialdilemma.com/) on the dangerous impact of social media companies on our own mental health and on our society as a whole. In addition, the online advertising industry breaches our right to privacy by [extracting our data and monetizing it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism) in any form they can. Byoda addresses both these issues by delivering the _privacy-first_ social media platform.
